You know what? I've been practicing writing a gratitude list recently (I know I'm probably late, but better late than never?!).
 
Hmm, one thing I realized is that we don‚Äôt say thank you often enough to all of you who've been supportive of us. Today, the entire team from SEOPressor would like to take the opportunity to express our gratitude towards you. 
 
Since you‚Äôre here today (lucky you!), we wanted to give you an instant discount on LSIGraph that we managed to get for you guys. This will be the last email reminding you that you have a great deal awaiting you üòâ. 
 
If you haven‚Äôt subscribed to them, I'd say now is the perfect chance to do so!##END##
