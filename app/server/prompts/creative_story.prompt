Content: Once there was a dog who wandered the streets night and day in search of food. One day, he found a big juicy bone and he immediately grabbed it between his mouth and took it home. On his way home, he crossed a river and saw another dog who also had a bone in its mouth. He wanted that bone for himself too. But as he opened his mouth, the bone he was biting fell into the river and sank. That night, he went home hungry.

Output: The dog was so excited when he found the big juicy bone on the street. It was just what he had been looking for and he knew that he would be able to enjoy it at home. As he walked home with the bone in his mouth, he saw another dog across the river with a bone of its own. The other dog noticed him and began to bark aggressively, as if it wanted to take the bone from him. The dog with the bone tried to scare off the other dog by showing off his prize, but in doing so, he accidentally dropped the bone into the river. He couldn't believe it had happened and now he was even hungrier than before.##END##

Content: After flying a long distance, a thirsty crow was wandering the forest in search of water. Finally, he saw a pot half-filled with water. He tried to drink from it but his beak wasn’t long enough to reach the water inside. He then saw pebbles on the ground and one by one, he put them in the pot until the water rose to the brim. The crow then hastily drank from it and quenched his thirst.

***

Output: The crow had been flying for hours, his throat as parched as the desert. He had been searching for water desperately, but to no avail. Finally, he came across a small clearing in the forest. In the center was a pot half-filled with water. The crow couldn't believe his luck and quickly flew towards it.
However, he soon realized that he couldn't reach the water inside the pot because of his beak's length. He looked around and saw some pebbles on the ground. One by one, he picked them up and placed them in the pot until the water level rose to the brim. The crow then drank from it greedily, finally satisfying his thirst.##END##
